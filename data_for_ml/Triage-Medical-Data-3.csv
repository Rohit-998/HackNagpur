**Critical Questions:**
• Does the pain radiate to arm, jaw, or back?
• Any associated symptoms like sweating or nausea?
• Family history of heart disease?
• Current medications and cardiac risk factors?

**Red Flags:**
• Exertional chest pain pattern
• Progressive symptoms
• Multiple cardiac risk factors likely

**Possible Conditions:** Stable Angina, Hypertensive heart disease, Coronary artery disease

**Clinical Reasoning:** Presentation suggests stable but concerning cardiac symptoms requiring observation and workup.

• Is there any chest pain or shortness of breath?

**Red Flags:**
• Post-flight onset suggests possible DVT risk
• Unilateral leg warmth and swelling

**Possible Conditions:** Deep Vein Thrombosis, Superficial thrombophlebitis, Muscle strain

**Clinical Reasoning:** While symptoms suggest possible DVT following air travel (a known risk factor), the presentation is mild and patient is ambulatory.

**Red Flags:**
• Development of high fever (>101.5°F)
• Sudden increase in pain intensity
• Development of rebound tenderness

**Possible Conditions:** Early appendicitis, Mesenteric adenitis, Gastroenteritis

**Clinical Reasoning:** Presentation suggests possible early appendicitis requiring observation and serial exams, but current symptoms are mild enough to warrant close monitoring rather than immediate intervention.
